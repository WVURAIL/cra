# Classroom Radio Astronomy

This site provides support for teachers interested in doing radio astronomy in their classrooms, or anyone who wants to build a horn radio telescope. It is developed and maintained by teachers who have participated in the Digitial Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy (DSPIRA) program, which is an NSF funded Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program at the Lane Department of Computer Science and Engineering at West Virginia University. The Principal Investigators are Professors Natalia Schmid and Kevin Bandura. The Green Bank Observatory coordinator is Richard Prestage.

This site provides information on how to construct and operate a horn radio telescope as well as lesson plans and ideas on incorporating radio astronomy in the classroom.

## Radio Telescope Horn Construction

1. Basic Design

   * [Basic Horn Construction](http://www.wvurail.org/cra/Files_uploaded/blob/master/DSPIRA_Horn_Assembly.pdf)
   
   * [Horn Design and Construction, with Photos](https://github.com/WVURAIL/cra/Files_uploaded/blob/master/HornTelescope_Design_CRA.pdf)
   
   * Information on Constructing a Low Noise Amplifier
  
      The LNA that is used with horn telescopes is not commercially available. Here are 2 options:
    
      a. Build the LNA yourself. You will need to purchase all the components and solder the board together. This is a fun project in itself. All the schematics/hardware etc. are open and public. 
      
          - Schematics etc. can be found here: https://github.com/WVURAIL/os_radio_astro_hw
          
          - Circuit boards can be purchased here: https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/qHhrAlnI

      b. Use a different amplifier system using discrete components.  If you plan to go this way, there are some recommendations already on the opensourceradiotelescopes.org site. This is more expensive, but will be much easier.
